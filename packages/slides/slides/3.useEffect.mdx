```jsx
class Counter extends Component {
    state = {
        counter: 0
    }

    componentDidMount() {
        document.title = `Ready to count!`;
    }

    componentDidUpdate(props, state) {
        if (this.state.counter !== state.counter) {
            document.title = `Counted: ${state.counter}`;
        }
    }

    render() {
        return <div>
            <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
            <p>Count: {counter}<p> 
            <button onClick={decrement}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    }
}
```

<div>

Again, counter, but with a twist. We'll skip the state part, for now.

As you can see, we're updating the document title on changes. 

Which means...

</div>

</Step>

<Step>

```diff 6:8
```

We need to update on mount...

</Step>

<Step>


```diff 10:15
```

And on component update, to check if the counter has indeed changed, and then update the title.

</Step>

<Step>

```jsx
const Counter = () => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    useEffect(
        () => document.title = `Counted ${count}`,
        [count],
    );
    useEffect(
        () => document.title = `Ready to count`,
        [],
    );

    return <div>
        <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
        <p>Count: {counter}<p> 
        <button onClick={decrement}>Increment</button>
    </div>;
}
```

<div>

In hooks, we can simulate both, but with better control.

</div>

</Step>

<Step>

```diff 4:7
```

We can update the title on `count` changes...

</Step>

<Step>


```diff 8:11
```

And on `mount` (in hooks terms, execute effect only once).

</Step>

<Step>


```diff 4:7
```

<div>

Let's break it down.

This translates to: 

</div>

</Step>

<Step>


```diff 5
```

<div>

Execute this function

</div>

</Step>

<Step>


```diff 6
```

<div>

When an item in this array has changed (in our case, `count`)

</div>

</Step>

<Step>


```diff 8:11
```

<div>

Whereas this translates to: 

</div>

</Step>

<Step>


```diff 9
```

<div>

Execute this function...

</div>

</Step>

<Step>


```diff 10
```

<div>

When... well, our array is empty, so only once. 

A `null`/`undefined` parameter, instead of an empty array would mean 'execute every time'.

</div>

</Step>

```jsx
const NotificationsBadge = ({ id }) => {
    const [notifications, setNotifications] = useState([]);

    useEffect(
        () => {
            const subscription = API.subscribeToNotifications(
                id,
                notification => setNotifications(
                    notifications => [...notifications, notification]
                )
            );
            return subscription.unsubscribe;
        },
        [id],
    );

    return (...);
}
```

<div>

Let's take another example. Subscribing to notifications.

We want to subscribe to notifications for a given `id`, but **unsubscribe** and **resubscribe** once the `id` changes.

</div>

</Step>

<Step>

```diff 4:15
```

<div>

Let's break this one down, as well, and see how the unsubscribe works.

Let's say our subscription API has a `subscribeToNotifications` function that takes in an `id` and a callback with new notifications.

The subscription also has an `unsubscribe` method.

</div>

</Step>

<Step>

```diff 14
```

<div>

Our first step, actually, is to define our dependencies. 

In other words, **when do we do make any changes**?

In our case, when the `id` changes, naturally

</div>

</Step>

<Step>

```diff 6:11
```

<div>

Then we subscribe to our notifications.

We're not going to go into state, but the `subscription` variable. Right now, we're subscribed to notifications for `id = 3`, let's say.

A `useEffect` hook will execute the return value from the execution function on subsequent hook functions. Therefore...

</div>

</Step>

<Step>

```diff 12
```

<div>

We return our unsubscribe method.

</div>

</Step>



<Step>

```diff
```

<div>

Let's take an overall look, again, and go through it.

</div>

<Layout>

# useEffect - Takeaways

- Scoped to memoized input array
- Takes in an effect function
- Effect function acts as an effect constructor, that returns the effect destructor
- Creates a subscription
- Handles functionality
- Returns the unsubscribe handler

</Layout>

<Layout>

# useEffect - Best Practices

- Don't duplicate effects on input array
- Use block functions as a default, to prevent useEffect interpreting any return values as functions (when they are by-products of an update process, for example)
- If dealing with effects that need destructuring on change, make sure to return a destructure function
