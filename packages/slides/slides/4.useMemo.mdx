```jsx
const Counter = () => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    const [hasCounted, setHasCounted] = useState(false);
    useEffect(
        () => { 
            if (count !== 0) { 
                setHasCounted(true); 
            } 
        },
        [count],
    );

    const title = useMemo(
        () => hasCounted ? `Counted ${count}` : `Ready to count`,
        [hasCounted, count],
    );
    useEffect(
        () => document.title = title,
        [title],
    );

    return <div>
        <h1>{title}</h1>
        <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
        <p>Count: {counter}<p> 
        <button onClick={decrement}>Increment</button>
    </div>;
}
```

<div>

Let's take the counter example again.

</div>

</Step>

<Step>

```diff 2
```

<div>

We have our counter state...

</div>

</Step>

<Step>

```diff 4
```

<div>

But we take another state, that we will update with `useEffect`, to show the difference.

</div>

</Step>


<Step>

```diff 5:12
```

<div>

We use a `useEffect` to update our `hasCounted` on `count` change, as long as `count` is different from 0.

</div>

</Step>

<Step>

```diff 14:17
```

<div>

However, `useMemo` can be more helpful while **deriving** data from state.

In this case, we're depending on `hasCounted` and `count` to compute the title (both of the component, and the document).

`useMemo` has the same pattern as all the other hooks, a function to be executed, when any of the dependencies have changed. 

The result of the function will be assigned to the variable (in our case, `title`);

</div>

</Step>



<Step>

```diff 18:21
```

<div>

We can use a `useEffect` more effectively when there is a side-effect to be considered, such as updating the document title.

</div>

</Step>

# useMemo - Takeaways

- Granular Control
- Memoized Returns
- Mostly used for derived data
- Takes a function that returns the value ( () => T ) 

</Layout>

# useMemo - Best Practices

- Use as much as needed instead of useState
- Be careful with the input array, make sure it's satisfactory to the output
- Remember that useState setters change on value set
- If derived data is a function, use useCallback instead
