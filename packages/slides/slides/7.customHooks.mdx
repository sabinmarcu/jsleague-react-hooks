<div style={{ maxWidth: 1000 }}>

It is both an *incredibly simple concept*, as a *incredibly powerful concept*. This way, functionality used throughout the application (or business, or the open source community, etc) can easily be abstracted, refactored and distributed.

It also allows for logic to be abstracted away from the rendering portion, without any over-head.
